### 4.1 Web Script
::: tip 原文
  A web browser provides an ECMAScript host environment for client-side computation including, for instance, objects
that represent windows, menus, pop-ups, dialog boxes, text areas, anchors, frames, history, cookies, and
input/output. Further, the host environment provides a means to attach scripting code to events such as change of
focus, page and image loading, unloading, error and abort, selection, form submission, and mouse actions. Scripting
code appears within the HTML and the displayed page is a combination of user interface elements and fixed and
computed text and images. The scripting code is reactive to user interaction, and there is no need for a main program.<br/>
  A web server provides a different host environment for server-side computation including objects representing
requests, clients, and files; and mechanisms to lock and share data. By using browser-side and server-side scripting
together, it is possible to distribute computation between the client and server while providing a customized user
interface for a Web-based application.<br/>
  <div class="tip-aqua">Each Web browser and server that supports ECMAScript supplies its own host environment, completing the
ECMAScript execution environment.</div>
:::
<div class="tip-aqua">每个支持ECMA的web浏览器和服务器都提供其自身的宿主环境，完成ECMA执行环境</div>

### 4.2 hosts and implementations
::: tip 原文
To aid integrating ECMAScript into host environments, this specification defers the definition of certain facilities (e.g.,
abstract operations), either in whole or in part, to a source outside of this specification. Editorially, this specification
distinguishes the following kinds of deferrals
:::
为了将ECMA整合到宿主环境，本规范推迟了部分整体和局部的争对本规范外的Source的功能(facilities)的定义(比如抽象操作)。社论上，本规范区分为以下几种"推迟"

::: tip defferrals
An `implementation` is an external source that further defines facilities enumerated in Annex D or those that are marked as implementation-defined or implementation-approximated. In informal use, an implementation refers to a concrete artefact, such as a particular web browser.<br/>
An `implementation-defined facility` is one defers its definition to an external source without further qualification.This specification does not make any recommendations for particular behaviours, and conforming implementations are free to choose any behaviour within the constraints put forth by this specification.<br/>
An `implementation-approximated facility` is one defers its definition to an external source while recommending an ideal behaviour. While conforming implementations are free to choose any behaviour within the constraints put forth by this specification, they are encouraged to strive to approximate the ideal. Some mathematical operations, such as Math.exp, are implementation-approximated.<br/>
A `host` is an external source that further defines facilities listed in Annex D but does not further define other implementation-defined or implementation-approximated facilities. In informal use, a host refers to the set of all implementations, such as the set of all web browsers, that interface with this specification in the same way via AnnexD. A host is often an external specification, such as WHATWG HTML (https://html.spec.whatwg.org/). In other words, facilities that are host-defined are often further defined in external specifications.<br/>
A `host hook` is an abstract operation that is defined in whole or in part by an external source. All host hooks must be listed in Annex D.<br/>
A `host-defined facility` is one defers its definition to an external source without further qualification and is listed in Annex D. Implementations that are not hosts may also provide definitions for host-defined facilities.<br/>
A `host environment` is a particular choice of definition for all host-defined facilities. A host environment typically includes objects or functions which allow obtaining input and providing output as host-defined properties of the global object

### 4.3ECMAScript Overview
::: tip 摘抄
 ECMAScript is object-basic ... an ECMAScript program is a cluster of communicating objects<br/>
<div class="tip-aqua">
A primitive value is a member of one of the following built-in types: Undefined, Null, Boolean, Number, BigInt, String, and Symbol; an object is a member of the built-in type Object; and a function is a callable object. A function that is associated with an object via a property is called a method.
</div>
ECMAScript also defines a set of built-in operators. ECMAScript operators include various unary operations,
multiplicative operators, additive operators, bitwise shift operators, relational operators, equality operators, binary
